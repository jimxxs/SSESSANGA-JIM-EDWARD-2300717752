# Road Crossing Reinforcement Learning Agent

This project implements a reinforcement learning agent that learns to navigate and cross a road safely. The agent interacts with a simulated environment where it can take actions to move right, left, or stay in place. The goal is to maximize the reward by successfully crossing the road while avoiding obstacles.

## Project Structure

```
road-cross-rl-agent
├── src
│   ├── agent.py          # Defines the Agent class for reinforcement learning
│   ├── environment.py    # Simulates the road-crossing environment
│   ├── train.py          # Contains the training loop for the agent
│   └── utils.py          # Utility functions for logging and model management
├── requirements.txt      # Lists project dependencies
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd road-cross-rl-agent
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To train the reinforcement learning agent, run the following command:
```
python src/train.py
```

This will initialize the agent and environment, and start the training process. The agent will learn to navigate the road-crossing scenario over multiple episodes.
